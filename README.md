# GardenSim
GardenSim is an interactive simulation that uses artificial intelligence to model and predict plant growth based on real-world factors such as sunlight, water, soil conditions, and weather. Users can plant virtual seeds, adjust environmental settings, and observe how AI models adapt plant health and growth patterns over time.
